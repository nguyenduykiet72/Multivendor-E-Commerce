### Multivendor E-commerce website 

### Overview
This Multivendor E-commerce project leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to create a comprehensive online marketplace where multiple vendors can list and sell their products. The platform provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for both vendors and customers, featuring robust functionalities such as product management, order processing, and payment integration. This project aims to facilitate a dynamic E-commerce environment while enhancing my skills in full-stack development and applying modern web technologies.


## Objectives
- **Enhance Development Skills**: Improve my skills in front-end and back-end development, focusing on both the integration and individual components of the stack.
- **Learn and Apply MERN Stack**: Gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack technologies by building a fully functional application from the scratch.
- **Practice**: Implement best practices in coding, version control, and project management.
- **Build a Portfolio Piece**: Create a project that can be showcased as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities and progress.
